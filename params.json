Lime\r\nLight calls these APIs their Transaction and Membership APIs, we've implemented them as\r\n``limelight.transaction`` and ``limelight.membership``. Both are essentially an 1:1 mapping of\r\npythonic-as-possible functions to API methods. Unfortunately, Lime Light's API is pretty much all\r\nover the place. It's comprehensive and useful, but not well organized or consistent.\r\n\r\nOur solution is designed for both flexibility and ease of use: the entire API is exposed in python\r\nin the aforementioned modules and is used as machinery for a much more cohesive interface to the\r\nCRM.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
